# enos_kubernetes_pods (Data Source)

The `enos_kubernetes_pods` datasource can be used to query a kubernetes cluster for pods, using
label and field selectors. Details on the syntax for label and field selectors can be seen [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/).

**Important Note:**

As this is a datasource it will be run during plan time, unless the datasource
depends on information not available till apply. Therefore, if this datasource is used in a module
where the kubernetes cluster is being created at the same time, you must make the datasource depend
either directly or indirectly on the resources required for the cluster to be created and the app
to be deployed.

## Schema

### Required

- `context_name` (String) The name of the cluster context to connect to. The context must exist in cluster
