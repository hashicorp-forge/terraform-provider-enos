# enos_environment (Data Source)

The `enos_environment` datasource is a datasource that we can use to pass environment specific
information into our Terraform run. As enos relies on SSH to execute the bulk of its actions, a
common problem is granting access to the host executing the Terraform run. As such, the
enos_environment resource can be used to determine our external IP addresses so that we can dynamically
generate security groups that allow only access from our end.
